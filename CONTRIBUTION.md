## How To Contribute

- Fork the project on GitHub, clone it on your PC.
- If you spot a problem with the docs, [search if an issue already exists](https://github.com/ZeroOctave/resource-gallery/issues). If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.
- If you'd like to work on an issue, please ask the creator of the issue to assign it to you. This helps to keep the workflow streamlined.
- Create a new branch for your contribution and make the changes you want to make. (Always check for updates on the main branch before creating a pull request to avoid merge conflicts.)
- The pull request should mention the issue it is trying to solve and should be linked to it.
- Make sure to make the appropriate changes in the README.md file if you are adding a new script or feature.

### Ask Questions
If you want to ask a question, join the 'resource-gallery' project channel on the GSSoC discord server. You can self-assign it in the #self-roles channel.
